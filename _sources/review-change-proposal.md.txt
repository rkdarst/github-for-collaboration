# Review a change someone else submitted

## Background

Once someone proposes a change, there are powerful ways to discuss it,
request changes, and accept it.

## How to

* In the repository, click the `Pull Requests` tab.  This shows what
  everyone has done.
* Examine it
  * The title and description
  * There is a whole conversation below that
  * Anyone can add comments to the discussion.
  * "Files changed" shows exactly what was changed
  * "Checks" can validate that the syntax is correct.
* You can do the following:
  * **Merge** it (accept it)
  * Add comments and request changes
  * Make suggestions/changes directly yourself
  * **Close** it if you don't want it.

## What we get

* The reviewing part also becomes a way to form a community of
  contributions.
