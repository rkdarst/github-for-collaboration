# Future

What have we learned now?

## Benefits

```{admonition} Questions

* Is this worth anything, compared to what we have?
* For what kinds of projects is this worth it?
```

## How to make it more usable

```{admonition} Question

* This can work, but is it usable enough?  *No...*
* Anyone in the audience know how to make things better?
* Do we need to make it more usable?
* Does anyone know existing interfaces that are better?
```

## If you want to know more:
* If at Aalto: Contact Aalto RSE, we can help you with anything here
  <https://scicomp.aalto.fi/rse/>
  * Set up a new project
  * Advice on existing projects
* Contact your local research software engineers or git users.  This
  is fairly standard stuff.
* I don't know any resources dedicated to non-programmers, but there
  should be.


## Final discussion

```{admonition} Questions?

* Any questions from the audience?
* Was this easy enough for simple things?
* Are the features worth learning something better enough to do this
  more easily?
```
