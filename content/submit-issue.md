# Submit an issue

## Background

Any project that's alive needs a way for those working on it to
communicate.  If that's locked in private emails or one organization's
chat, it's hard for others to take part.

Sometimes you want to discuss before making changes, or you see
something that needs to be done but you can't do it right now.

In these cases, **Github Issues** allow these ideas to be tracked.

## How to

* Navigate to the repository of the page
* Click `Issues`
* You can browse open issues.
* Click `New issue`.
* Give a title, message, and click "submit".
