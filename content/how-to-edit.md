# How to use Github for open information

## View history of a single page

* Click the "Edit on GitHub" button, then find "History" from there.
* Try clicking "Blame" (left side, down a bit).  This is not a good
  term, but shows exactly when each part was changed.
* Click "Code" to see the raw source.  This is what it looks like
  "under the hood"

## Edit an existing page

* From the "Edit on GitHub" link, click the ‚úè pencil icon above the text
  (right side, slightly down the page).
* Copy some syntax that you can already see, if you want something.
* Don't worry about making mistakes: it might look weird, you can
  check and see, and try again / ask someone else to take a look.
* What if you aren't sure you got it right?  You can take the same
  option as "outside your organization" and make a pull request - then
  no changes until reviewed and approved!

### The syntax?

* You can try it out at [the myst-tools sandbox: myst-tools.org/sandbox](https://myst-tools.org/sandbox)


## Create a new page

* First go to the site repository (click "Edit on GitHub" on some
  random page).
* In the file path, ("github-for-collaboration/content/test-page.md"),
  click "content".  This shows the view of all pages.
* On the right side, a bit down, you can "create new file"
* I'd recommend copying a file from a different place.

## Someone outside your organization: edit a page

* All the same steps as above
* It won't let them make a page.  Instead, it will offer to "fork this
  repository and create a pull request"

## Review a change someone else submitted

* In the repository, click the "Pull Requests" tab.  This shows what
  everyone has done.
* Examine it
  * The title and description
  * There is a whole conversation below that
  * Anyone can add comments to the discussion.
  * "Files changed" shows exactly what was changed
  * "Checks" can validate that the syntax is correct.

## What else?

```{admonition} Questions?

* Any questions from the audience?
* Was this easy enough for simple things?
* Are the features worth learning something better enough to do this
more easily?
```
