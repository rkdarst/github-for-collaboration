# View history of a single page

## Background

Git stores *all* history of all past edits, and this is very useful.
You can:

* See when something was last updated
* See who last updated
* See what the update is (precisely - the *diff*)
* See a message about why it was done.

You need to find where it is on Github.  Many websites hosted there
have an "Edit on Github"


## How to

Find the right file:

* Click the `Edit on GitHub` button
* Or find the repository and navigate to the file you want.

Then try examining it:

* Find `History`. [example](https://github.com/rkdarst/github-for-collaboration/commits/main/content/how-to-edit.md)
* Try clicking `Blame` (left side, down a bit).  This is not a good
  term, but shows exactly when each part was changed. [example](https://github.com/AaltoSciComp/scicomp-docs/blame/master/triton/tut/array.rst)
* Click `Code` or `<>` to see the raw source.  This is what it looks like
  "under the hood".  [example](https://github.com/rkdarst/github-for-collaboration/blob/main/content/how-to-edit.md?plain=1)
