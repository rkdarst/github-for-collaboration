# Create a new page

* First go to the site repository (click `Edit on GitHub` on some
  random page).
* In the file path, (`github-for-collaboration/content/test-page.md`),
  click `content`.  This shows the view of all pages.

* On the right side, a bit down, you can "create new file"
* I'd recommend copying the basic structure of an existing file.
