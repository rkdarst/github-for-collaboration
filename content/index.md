# Github for collaboration by anyone

In open science, it's accepted that "email me for the data" isn't
enough - it must be easier than that.  Then, should "email me with updates
or corrections" be the standard for collaboration?

As examples, some of the largest, most well-known open projects don't
just release data but have ways to use it together:
* [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/): easy web interface to edit,
  defined policies for this.
* [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org): easy web interface
  to edit but also more powerful tools to do more powerful work.
* [The Turing Way](https://the-turing-way.netlify.app/): Open-source
  book where everyone can contribute.

FAIR is the standard for open data.  But is it the standard for how we
collaborate on science and science support in general?  And is there
something missing?  Can there be a **C** in FAIR, that stands for
**Collaborative**?
