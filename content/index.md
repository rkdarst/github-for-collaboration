# Github for collaboration by anyone

FAIR is the standard for open data.  But is it the standard for how we
collaborate on science and science support in general?  And is there
something missing?  Can there be a **C** in FAIR, that stands for
**Collaborative**?  As in, is our data (or other things) a
"release-only" thing, or can others contribute to our work to make it
better and give it a life beyond us?

As examples, some of the largest, most well-known open projects don't
just release data but have ways to use it together:
* Wikipedia: easy web interface to edit, defined policies for this.
* OpenStreetMap: easy web interface to edit but also more powerful
  tools to do more powerful work.
* The Turing Way: Open-source book where everyone can contribute.

For **writing and things like websites**, is there any way to be
collaborative?  That's what this talk is about.
