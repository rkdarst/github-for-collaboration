# Why collaboration?

## FAIR: One-way

* FAIR is what is needed to publish and reuse data
* What happens if it's published and never changes?
  * This happens when a version is citeable
  * But also things can be linked to newer versions
* Most people move on to other projects (especially in academia).  If
  you can't get others interested, does the project stay alive?

## What is data?

* The actual data we publish, of course.
* **But I want to actually talk about our collaboration-metadata
  more**.
  * **For example, this talk.  [The Aalto Research Data Management
    instructions aalto.fi/rdm](https://aalto.fi/rdm/)**
  * I think that these other things also deserve a FAIR treatment.
    **And especially the C-treatment**.

## What do we want?

* Anyone can view what the current version
* The history is available for inspection
  * The history includes information on each individual contribution
  * Old versions can be identified by a permanent identifier
* Others can contribute changes
  * Others can contribute changes without asking for permission...
  * ... but the changes can be reviewed and discussed *before*
    accepting them.
* It's possible to make other versions to test out ideas / adapt to
  different audiences
  * While still maintaining the link, so you can easily see the
    differences
  * ... and merge them together
* Open-source / no proprietary tools or software needed to do this
* Everything can be done from a web browser.
* **Easy enough for anyone to use it, with basic training**
  * but it's OK if it requires someone with more knowledge to set it
    up and occasionally do maintenance on it.

```{admonition} Audience question

* Any comments on these?
* What else would be useful?

```

## What can do this?

As far as we know, things such as Github are the only things that can
do this.  [Why Github?](why-github)
