# Create a new page

## Background

We need to create new pages also.  Luckily, we can do it!

## How-to

* First go to the site repository (click `Edit on GitHub` on some
  random page).
* In the file path, (`github-for-collaboration/content/test-page.md`),
  click `content`.  This shows the view of all pages.
* On the right side, a bit down, you can "create new file"
  ![Add new file](img/add-file.png)
* I'd recommend copying the basic structure of an existing file, which
  you can get by the "code view".
